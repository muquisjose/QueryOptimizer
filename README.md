## 🌟 Overview

QueryOptimizer is a powerful application for processing large datasets. It handles **1 billion (10^9)** rows with ease, focusing on techniques to manage memory and optimize performance. 

The application allows users to create, retrieve, and process massive datasets effectively. It uses methods like batch processing and multi-threading to ensure quick and reliable data handling.

### 🗄️ Database Schema

The application has a straightforward database schema. It includes a single table named **`value`** with these fields:
- `id` (Long, PRIMARY KEY): A unique identifier for each row.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The architecture of QueryOptimizer is built around the Spring Boot framework. This choice allows for rapid development and efficiency. The application separates concerns to enhance maintainability.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Batch Processing**: Handles large sets of data by processing them in batches.
- **Multi-Threading**: Manages multiple threads to maximize resource usage.
- **Memory Management**: Optimizes the use of available memory for efficient data processing.
- **Pagination Support**: Allows handling of large data sets in smaller segments for better performance.
- **High Scalability**: Designed to handle growth in data size without losing performance.

## 📈 Performance Metrics

QueryOptimizer is designed with performance in mind. Average testing shows:
- The ability to process 1 million rows in under 10 seconds.
- Efficient memory usage, utilizing less than 500 MB for operations.

## 📡 API Endpoints

The application provides a RESTful API for user interaction. Here are key endpoints:

- **GET /api/values**: Retrieve all values.
- **POST /api/values**: Create a new entry in the database.
- **GET /api/values/{id}**: Retrieve a specific value by ID.
- **DELETE /api/values/{id}**: Remove a specific entry from the database.
